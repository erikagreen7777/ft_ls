Rewrite shell command "ls" in the C language.

Building the program
Download/Clone the source code
cd into the root directory
Run make

Running the program
It's pretty simple, instead of calling ls, call ./ft_ls from the root directory of the source code after building it.

For complete requirements, please see the PDF: [ft_ls](https://github.com/erikagreen7777/ft_ls/blob/master/ft_ls.en.pdf)
