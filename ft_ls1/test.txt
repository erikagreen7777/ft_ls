**** MEMORY LEAKS ****
git addclear

- if date is greater than 6 months, write year instead
- print out the file name, not the complete path

-lexicographically sort switch_time if it's the same ctime (it works for something but test for everything)

************************************************
-ls -lt has a weird memory thing that seems to be made worse by pulling that out as a separate function. as does ./ft_ls -lta and
./ft_ls -lrat
