**** MEMORY LEAKS ****
git addclear

-list_dirlr is really long still

-list_dirta reticent on norming (function length). same for list_dirlr
 
- multiple arguments like -l -t -R -r -a instead of -ltRra

- print out the file name, not the complete path

-lexicographically sort switch_time if it's the same ctime (it works for something but test for everything)

-l isn't lexico sorted. Does it matter?

-r newline between directories?
